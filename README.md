# Task "localhost"
grit:lab Ã…land Islands 2023

## Description
Rust web server, HTTP/1.1 protocol compatible, able to run Python3 CGI scripts.  

**The repository file system structure is important.**  

For details/restrictions see [task and audit questions](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/localhost)

## Usage (non-macOS)
- open terminal in the repository root folder(the `README.md` location)

### Build the project:
- terminal: `./do`

### Run the project:
- terminal: `./runme`

### Development run the project(build and run, does not work with priveleged port):
- terminal: `./devrun`

### Run with priveleged port (like 80) in settings:  
- terminal: `sudo ./runme`  

It is not secure, and not recommended to use. But after that, with port `80` used inside `settings` file correct configuration, you can use `localhost` in the browser, without port number.  
Otherwise you need to use `localhost:8080` in the browser.  
Also `./devrun` script will not work with priveleged port. And you will see `Permission denied (os error 13) ... Failed to bind addr` error in the terminal.

## Usage (macOS)

### Add alias to allow `127.0.0.2` ip address, to demonstrate the configurations properly on MacOS:
- terminal: `sudo ifconfig lo0 127.0.0.1 up` just to be sure default ip is up.  
- terminal: `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up`  without this `127.0.0.2` is dead.  

Command above works only for current session. Next time/reboot you need to repeat it.  
The `lo0` interface is a software loopback interface that can be used for testing and communication between processes on the same machine. The command above is used to add an extra alias (127.0.0.2) for the loopback interface. Default loopback interface on MacOS is `127.0.0.1`.  

### Build the project:
- terminal: `./do`  

### Run the project:
- terminal: `sudo ./runme`  

## How server works:

- after build the project, the binary file `runme` will be created in the repository root folder.
- after execute `./runme` the server will try to start, according to the `settrings` file, which follows the TOML format. If any error occurs in initialization, the server will stop and print the error message in the terminal.
- after start the server will listen the ip:port configurations from the `settings` file, which will be printed in the terminal, like `Server` instances.

### Details and restrictions:

- `error 403 Forbidden`,  handling implemeted for case of access with directory uri with not GET method, as a way to enforce that only GET requests are allowed for directory URIs. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.  
To test it, you can use the `curl` commands in the terminal.  

Correct case using GET method (returns default file as task requires):  
`
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/
`  

Forbidden case using POST method (returns 403 error page):  
`
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/
`
- `cgi` functionality implemented in handlers separately, as old and unsafe technology, not recommended to use.  
According to the task requirements only one script enough to be implemented, and link to it hardcoded in the `runme` file, to prevent any extra activity/experiments.  
- `uploads` functionality implemented in handlers separately, and controlled using separated parameter in `settings` file, to prevent any extra activity/experiments.  
According to task, server should manage without problems static site.
Upload and delete files functionality is not a part of the static site, so it is implemented separately, universally for all sites, and hardcoded into `runme` file.  
The `settings` file allows to control accessibility of the `/uploads` page for each server settings, using methods `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, to download, upload, delete permissions respectively.  
- in case of `duplicated pairs for ip:port are used in settings`, as part of different configurations, the configuration added next in the `settings` file will override the previous one.  
- default `settings` file configuration, implements three different sites, with possibility to test the `redirect.html` page accessibility, depends on allowed methods, `curl --resolve` command, and one site to test the `empty.html` page using `siege` stress testing utility.  
- to keep the flow more stable, the body of the request will be ignored, if the headers of not chunked request does not include the `Content-Length` header.  Lot of clients automatically add this header, so it is not a problem.  

### Customization:

- the reading timeout is hardcoded, to prevent any extra activity/experiments. To change it, discover the `run` function of the `localhost/src/server/flow.rs` file.  
- the `DEBUG` boolean flag is hardcoded, to prevent any extra activity/experiments. To change it, discover the the `localhost/src/debug.rs` file. To use debug mode properly, you need increase the reading timeout, because debug implements the async sleep functionality, to monitor the flow of the server.  
- to use the executable separately from the project(not recommended), you need to keep in one folder:
- - the executable file `runme`.  
- - the `static` folder, includes the sites files.  
- - the `cgi` folder, includes the Python3 CGI script.  
- - the `uploads` folder, used to manage file uploads/deletions/shows for servers.  
It is not a static part of the project, and managed separately, to prevent extra activity. This folder includes `.gitignore` file, to prevent uploading files to the repository. Checking for `.gitignore` file is hardcoded into the `runme` file.  
For any configuration you can use `/uploads` to uploads page, which is hardcoded into the `runme` file.
- - the `settings` file, which is configured properly.  
Follow the examples in the `settings` file on your own risk, or do not touch it(it is educational project, aimed to satisfy task requirements in strictly limited time period).  

So finally it should looks like:
- `some_folder/runme` (executable)
- `some_folder/static` (folder)
- `some_folder/cgi` (folder)
- `some_folder/uploads` (folder)
- `some_folder/settings` (file)

### Site customization:

Do not create messy and follow examples style to structure sites. Or just do nothing.
Do not use spaces in the names of any folders and files.  

According to task methods `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` must be implemented. 
Do not use other methods to configure the server routes.  

Place inside the `static` folder the folder with the unique name of the site, f.e. `site2`, and inside the site folder place the `index.html` file and so on.  
Follow the examples in the `static` folder on your own risk, or do not touch it.  

The `settings` file must be configured properly to use the site.
The expectable structure of the site can be f.e. next:
- static/site2/favicon.ico
- static/site2/index.html
- static/site2/style/style.css
- static/site2/error/500.html  
According to task, the next error pages must be implemented: 400, 403, 404, 405, 413, 500.  
So you must provide the correct settings file configuration to error pages folder. And the error pages folder must contain properly created files: `400.html`, `403.html`, `404.html`, `405.html`, `413.html`, `500.html`.  

Otherwise, do not expect the server to run/initialize properly.  

## Audit and tests
To satisfy the task description requirement
> You can use the language you prefer to write tests, as long as they are exhaustive and the auditor can check their behavior.  
was choosen the next approach:  
- the testing process is manual
- the language of the tests description is English
- the tools used for testing are `curl` and `siege` utilities, and the browser
- the audit and tests description is located in the `extra.md` file in the repository root folder  
[extra.md](extra.md)
