# you should not play with this file without strong needs
# This file always must be on the same level as executable.
# The "default" server also will be used if no hits of other server ip:port happens
# in process of choosing configuration, based on request.
# So, DO NOT CHANGE THE "default" without strong needs.
# And keep in mind that this weird configuration (for me it looks ugly)
# aimed just to satisfy the task requirements and audit questions, not more.
